Observations:
- A single-core run (sequential), runs the single and double precision functions one after the other, therefore the time
taken is the sum of the excution times for both the functions. 
- A multi-core run (parallel), uses multiple cores of the CPU of the PI-PICO to execute the set of instructions together
at the same time, parallely instead of one after the other and thus both the functions take the same time frame to be excuted.
effectively multitasking.

Therefore it is noted that by leveraging multiple cores, the Multi-core approach i.e. parallel execution of the functions
is much faster than single-core i.e. sequential execution.
